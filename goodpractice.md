# Good practice

[Good Clinical Practice (GCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_clinical_practice) is an international standard describing best practice and ethical standards in clinical research. Though it is mainly applicable to trials, aspects of it may be useful for our group too, for instance:

* Detailed documentation of protocol(s),
* Record keeping,
* Data storage and security.

[Best practices for scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) is a useful overview of good computing practices. Amongst the most important of these is to use a version control system like Git for recording changes to code, and to make small changes between commits to the version control system.

[This article](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010139) includes some useful advice about good research practices. Particularly important aspects, which may be relevant to our group include:

* Pre-registration of protocols, including statistical analysis plans
* Make your research open - post code to GitHub, share data in public repositories, and post work to pre-print servers. Where possible, you may prefer to publish work in open access journals, and this may be a requirement for some grants
