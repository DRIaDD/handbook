# University policies

## Incident reporting

The Incident Reporting and Investigation System (IRIS), provided through collaborative efforts between IT Services and Safety Officers across the University. This secure online platform enables both staff and students to record incidents promptly.

The policy outlines requirements for reporting accidents, incidents, and near misses that could potentially cause harm. 

It is imperative that any event involving injury, fire, danger, or a close call be reported immediately to the university safety office. The online IRIS system allows the University to respond promptly and coordinate follow-up to occurrences impacting health, safety, or the environment.
               
[Click here for more information about the policy](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/ADMN-UASMosaicDocumentHub/Safety%20Office/03%20Health,%20Safety%20And%20Environmental%20Incident%20Reporting%20and%20Investigation_v1.0%20-%20March%202021.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=2iFm22).

The health, safety or environmental incident reporting form is to be used by all University personnel and students to report health, safety, and environmental incidents. Can be used globally on any device 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

## Desk space

The DRIaDD group is currently located on the lower ground floor of the Big Data Institute on the Old Road Campus. Office usage has evolved due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a hybrid work model in place for most staff. The policy on space and booking desks is detailed in [this document](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/TROP-TropicalMedicine/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9658BAAF-52E0-4DE4-829A-2973D3FF11CF%7D&file=BDI%20Hot%20Desking%20Policy.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true).

Desks are booked using the [Eden system](https://university-of-oxford-centre-for-human-genetics.team.eden.io/reservations). Desks should be reserved from noon on the Friday before you wish to come in. If you book a desk and are no longer coming into the office, please remove your reservation so someone else can use it. Further instructions on using the Eden system are detailed in [this document](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/TROP-TropicalMedicine/Shared%20Documents/BDI/BDI%20Eden%20User%20Instructions.docx?d=w1017e013a5534f4ab021d4cb072a81fe&csf=1&web=1&e=uUfOl8).

## Holidays / sick leave

Please check your contract for details on policy regarding the number of day sickness absence and annual leave you are entitled to. Please note that the current policy for CGHR is that all leave must be taken by 30 September each year. Only in exceptional circumstances may a maximum of 5 days be carried forward into the new leave year. This must be approved by both the group lead (Prof Ben Cooper), line manager and Dan Haggarty (Business manager). As is University policy, all approved carry forward must be used by 31 December of the same year requested. Where it is not, it will be cleared down automatically at the end of that day. To note, you cannot use carry forward against the NDM fixed closure days over the Christmas period- these will be automatically deducted from your personal balance entitlement.

Please send your requests for annual leave, check the details of the University policy, as well as check your personal balance entitlement through HR self-service using your SSO log-in.
