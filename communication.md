## Communication

In our research group, effective communication is key to fostering collaboration and sharing information. We've set up two main channels: *internal* ones for day-to-day communication among members, like email and Slack, in addition to online and in-person meetings. These meetings happen on either Microsoft Teams or Zoom, and you'll always get a formal invite via email to make sure you can easily add them to your schedule.

Our *external* communication is for more formal interactions with a wider public, such the department or projects' websites and social media. Results of our research are externally released usually through the publication of papers or presentations in conferences.

This guide is here to help everyone get the most out of these communication channels and make our collaborative efforts even more successful.
 
### Email

We use the institutional Outlook email for formal communication (for example, scheduling or confirming meetings; interacting with funders and wider collaborators from other departments or institutes).
 
### Slack

For quick and informal communication we usually use Slack, where you can add as many channels as you would like to participate. You should not expect to be able to contact people through this channel for urgent matters. However, we recommend you check them often.

On #random and #general channels you can also check reminders or advertisements about DRIaDD and MICROBE research meetings; in addition to suggestions for talks and seminars, webinars, events, blog posts and other topics of interest.

On #lab-handbook you can check our own lab-handbook guideline, which is constantly being updated. You will also find other examples of lab-handbooks for inspiration.

On #bdi_bookclub you can check the schedules for the book club presentations and for the DRIaDD and MICROBE research meetings (previously named "Journal Club"). You will also find or can post any comment or reminder related to these two group meetings.
 
Importantly, you might be added to other channels on Slack or meetings via Zoom or Teams depending on the project(s) you will be working on (such as the #gram channel mentioned above). Appropriate guidance will be sent to you via email by the leader of the team or other team members.
 
### Publications and conference presentations

All publications and conference presentations must be submitted to Symplectic when accepted. If you do not have access to Symplectic via your Single Sign On you can register at [https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/reporting/symplectic](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/reporting/symplectic)
 
Our publications are listed online at [https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/gram/publications](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/gram/publications)
 
Resources to help us to communicate our research more widely are available at [https://communications.admin.ox.ac.uk/research-communications](https://communications.admin.ox.ac.uk/research-communications)
 
### Website

To find departmental information you can consult the [website](https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/) or the social medias ([X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/TropMedOxford), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@TropMedOxford)). Through these channels you will find news, events, publications, research highlights and much more related to the Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health.
