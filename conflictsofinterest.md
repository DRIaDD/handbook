## Conflicts of interest

Conflicts of interest can be broadly described as situations where there is a potential risk that professional judgments or actions related to a primary interest (your duties to other people or organisation) may be unduly influenced by a secondary interest (personal or private). Secondary interests may be financial or non-financial or both, pose a risk of influencing students/ staff’s judgement or actions in ways that could favour the financial source inappropriately. Other secondary interests might involve pursuit of recognition, personal or private relationship (or a person with whom the staff or student has a close personal relationship) and professional career advancement. 

All staff and students must be aware of the University’s Conflict of Interest Policy. Details are accessible [here](https://researchsupport.admin.ox.ac.uk/governance/integrity/conflict/policy) which may require your SSO login to download the documents.
