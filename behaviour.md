## Expected behaviour

### Bully & harassment

We have zero tolerance for Harassment or discrimination. Should you witness or experience any such behaviour, It’s imperative to report any concerning incidents to an appropriate individual. Depending on the situation, this may be HR, your advisor, or university leadership. It’s crucial to treat your peers with respect. For preventive measures: creating awareness, building a positive environment and regular assessment such as conducting a survey or meetings.

### Place to ask for help

Always feel comfortable asking for assistance or explanations from fellow team members on any aspects. Collaboration is a key aspect of our team, and exchanging knowledge is highly encouraged. Experienced members should provide mentorship and support to junior members whenever it’s possible.

### Case of conflict

Approach the situation calmly and respectfully. It's essential to engage in open and respectful communication. Avoiding using aggressive language or emotional responses. Focusing on finding mutually acceptable solutions, emphasizing common goals of interest. Seeking the assistance of a mediator to facilitate fair and constructive resolutions. The aim is to resolve the conflict amicably, maintaining positive relationships and a collaborative environment.

### Open communication

The communication should be characterized by honesty, clarity and respect. It involves expressing thoughts and feelings clearly and directly, while also being receptive to the perspective of others. Active listening is so crucial, ensuring that you understand and acknowledge what others are saying. It’s important to maintain a non-judgemental and empathic attitude, fostering an environment where everyone feels safe and valued in sharing their ideas and concerns.

### Share resources

It's important to do so fairly and equitably, ensuring that all team members or stakeholders have access to what they need. Transparency is key; clearly communicate what resources are available and any guidelines for their use. Be considerate of others' needs and priorities, and try to accommodate them whenever possible. If resources are limited, prioritize their allocation based on collective goals and the most pressing requirements. Finally, encourage a culture of collaboration and mutual support, where resources are shared not just efficiently, but also in a way that fosters teamwork and collective success.

### Respective conversation

It's crucial to listen actively and attentively, showing genuine interest in the other person's perspective. Use polite language and maintain a tone that is considerate and free from aggression or condescension. Avoid interrupting and allow the other person ample time to express their thoughts. Acknowledge differing viewpoints without dismissing them, and strive to understand rather than immediately counter-argue. Above all, treat the conversation as an opportunity for mutual learning and understanding, rather than a platform for asserting dominance or superiority.

### Ethical conducts

The procedure involves consistently acting with integrity and honesty in all interactions and decisions. It requires adherence to both the letter and spirit of laws, regulations, and internal policies. Ethical conduct also means treating everyone with respect and fairness, avoiding conflicts of interest, and maintaining confidentiality when required. Transparency and accountability are key, with individuals taking responsibility for their actions and decisions. Additionally, it's important to foster an environment where ethical concerns can be raised without fear of retaliation, encouraging a culture of open and ethical practices.

### Time management

Effective time management involves prioritising tasks based on their importance and urgency, and allocating appropriate time to each task to meet deadlines efficiently. It's crucial to stay organised, set realistic goals, and avoid procrastination, while also being flexible enough to adapt to unforeseen changes or challenges. Good time management also includes taking regular breaks to maintain productivity and mental well-being.
EDI (Equity, Diversity and Inclusion): This involves actively recognizing and valuing the differences in others, whether they relate to race, gender, age, religion, disability, or sexual orientation. It's about creating an environment where everyone feels respected, included, and given equal opportunities to contribute and advance. This includes challenging discriminatory behaviours and biases, both conscious and unconscious, and ensuring that policies and practices promote inclusivity. Additionally, it's important to engage in continuous learning and dialogue about diversity and inclusion to foster a more understanding and equitable workplace or community.
