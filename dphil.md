## Overview of studying a DPhil course in University of Oxford

It is possible to study for a DPhil on a part-time basis. Typically, completing a DPhil on a part-time schedule necessitates *six to eight years of study*, contrasting with the *three to four years* typically required for full-time enrollment. However, part-time study may not be suitable for all projects, and it is advisable to consult with your supervisor to ensure they can accommodate such an arrangement.

As a part-time student, you are expected to engage in a *minimum of thirty days of university-based work each year*, subject to agreement with your supervisor, for the duration of your enrollment unless granted individual dispensation by the Board. During the probationary period, attendance requirements must consider relevant induction and training events scheduled by the Board. You will have the opportunity to customise your part-time research in consultation with your supervisor and establish a mutually agreed-upon attendance schedule.

Please refer to the student book and [this webpage](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/dphil-medical-sciences) for more information.
 
Should consider sources of fundings to support the duration of course, especially for part-time courses.

## Key assessment

### Change of supervisor(s) or appointment of joint supervisors

[GSO.25](https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/GSO.25_4.docx)

### Transfer to DPhil

All students will begin as Probationer Research Students (PRS). Within a maximum of six terms for full-time students or twelve terms for part-time students, you must apply for transfer to DPhil status. This application is typically made by the fourth term for full-time students and by the eighth term for part-time students.

A successful transfer will require a written report outlining your project plans and obtained data; and an interview with two assessors not directly involved in your supervision. Students should discuss with their supervisors on who could be the assessors. At least one of the assessors must have supervised a DPhil to completion at Oxford. One of the assessors should be from outside the applicant’s Department. Sub fusc is not required for the transfer of status assessment examination.

Checklist before transfer of status:
* Submit an application (GSO2.MSD form)
* Report of no more than 3,000 words (always double-check the format required)
* Signatures (could take time especially if supervisors are busy hence always a good idea to start the process early)
* A Training Needs Assessment form

### Confirmation

Students who transfer successfully will then apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status within nine terms for full-time students (no later than their ninth term from admission) and eighteen terms for part-time students. Confirmation examination will require a written report outlining your thesis plan (both content and timeline) and an interview with two assessors not directly involved in your supervision. Your assessors for the confirmation examination can be the same as those who examined your transfer of status, but they cannot be your final thesis & viva voca examiner. Students should discuss with their supervisors on who could be the assessors. Sub fusc is not required for the confirmation assessment examination.

Checklist before confirmation: GSP14.MSD form

### Thesis and viva voce

Full-time students are expected to submit a 50,000-word thesis after three or four years from admission. Part-time students must submit their thesis after six or eight years from admission. A DPhil in Medical Sciences is awarded upon successful defence of the thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.
Students should discuss with their supervisors on who could be the assessors.

## Some ways (optional) to maximise the student experiences

* Join MORU-OUCRU student committee (Leigh Jones)
* Find a mentor
* Well-being and mental health
* College selection: Colleges are meant to provide University members with a community to participate in beyond the academic environment. You can choose a college based on the specific resources you are interested in (including funding available for specific studies), type of accommodation you are interested in (depending on your budget, location, family and other special needs), type of facilities you are looking forward to have access to (gym, sport clubs, music room, dark room, theatre/screening room, conference facilities), food and catering services you are keen in using (some colleges have limited catering options). Colleges would consider whether a student is a suitable member of their community based on both academic and non-academic background, and some colleges tend to concentrate on research subjects while others are more diverse. The Medical Science division has guidance on colleges with a clinical background, pre-clinical background, biomedical background, to name a few.
* Student network: The Oxford University Student Union can provide guidance on the wide variety of student networks available, including studentships and scholarships available. Also consider the Colleges’ Common Room website to know resources available from them.
