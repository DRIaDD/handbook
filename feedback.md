# How to provide feedback

Feedback is an important anchor of social interaction, and an opportunity for development, for bringing out your ideas and for starting an open conversation. Communication techniques (such as Active listening, Action-Impact-Do or Nonviolent communication) are approached and practised within several fora in the University such as the [Communications Foundations](https://cosy.ox.ac.uk/accessplan/LMSPortal/UI/Page/Courses/book.aspx?courseid=COLE0068&referrer=coursesearch), [Communication Tips](https://cosy.ox.ac.uk/accessplan/LMSPortal/UI/Page/Courses/book.aspx?courseid=COLE0069&referrer=coursesearch), [Leadership in Action](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/training/courses/leadership-in-action) courses, to cite a few.

If you don't feel comfortable giving or receiving feedback directly, you can use *periodic surveys* to gather feedback.
