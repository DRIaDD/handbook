## Lab meetings
We have two weekly whole-group lab meetings: the weekly meeting and book club. Both are scheduled for an hour. Let Sean know if you have not received the calendar invite for these. Both meetings are run in a hybrid fashion, in-person in the BDI and over Zoom.

### Weekly meeting

Presenters and chairs are listed in this spreadsheet: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8GJCW1i6KS3plXev6Bg5qGPuXc7j1_WBSv-9ZHdxxU/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8GJCW1i6KS3plXev6Bg5qGPuXc7j1_WBSv-9ZHdxxU/edit#gid=0).

Presenters typically either choose to present an update on their research or a paper for discussion. It's up to the presenter what they choose to do. If presenting a paper, please propose the paper by Wednesday lunchtime so that people have a couple of days to read the paper.

Chair's responsibilities include:

* Preparing meeting room if in person (if working from home that day, please make sure someone else is preparing the meeting room)
* Calling on people for updates
* Raising any other group-wide issues
* Checking in on group-wide projects, such as the lab handbook
* Keeping the meeting to time
* Managing the discussion (if appropriate - the presenter may be better placed to do this)

### Book club 

Books decided by vote on Slack; we have read a combination of both textbooks and more popular science type books

Typically more informal discussion over lunch when we read a popular science book, and more formal with an allocated presented for textbooks

When reading a textbook, presenters will be listed in the same spreadsheet as for journal club (in the book club sheet): [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8GJCW1i6KS3plXev6Bg5qGPuXc7j1_WBSv-9ZHdxxU/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8GJCW1i6KS3plXev6Bg5qGPuXc7j1_WBSv-9ZHdxxU/edit#gid=0) 

Additionally, members of the Global Research on AntiMicrobial Resistance (GRAM) project have a weekly team meeting on Weds 1.30 to 3pm in Teams/BDI Conference room, and a spatial modelling meeting fortnightly on Weds 9am (including Benn Sartorius) on Teams. There is a slack channel #gram, everyone can join.
