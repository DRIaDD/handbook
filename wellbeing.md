# Well-being and mental health

## Resources

Mental health and well-being resources are provided differently for [staff](https://occupationalhealth.admin.ox.ac.uk/mental-health) and [students](https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/welfare/mentalhealthandwellbeing) within the University. However, the [NDM sharepoint for wellbeing](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/CLME-HUB-NuffieldDepartmentofMedicine/SitePages/Wellbeing.aspx) collates many resources (though mainly for staff), including a list of [Mental Health allies](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/CLME-HumanResources/SitePages/Mental-Health-First-Aiders.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=s8WLO8) which could point you in the right direction (during work hours) to access support. 

## Mentoring and coaching

Guidance and resources can be found on the [People and Organisational Development website](https://pod.admin.ox.ac.uk/mentoring) and on the [NDM mentoring space](https://038.medsci.ox.ac.uk/working-for-ndm/further-development/mentoring-and-coaching).

## Career planning: the following resources can be useful

Career development reviews: For fixed-term researchers the University offers a structured and confidential conversation on career goals, opportunities, aspirations and prospects of careers in any sector or role and how to further development and related skills. Guidance is available from the [CDR webpage](https://www.ox.ac.uk/research/support-researchers/researcher-hub/career-development-reviews-fixed-term-researchers).
