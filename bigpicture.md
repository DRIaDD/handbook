## Mission and vision	 	 	

* We are dedicated to leveraging multidisciplinary approaches to help understand and control infectious diseases with a particular focus on antimicrobial resistance and emerging infections with pandemic potential. 
* Our work encompasses fundamental problems in infectious disease epidemiology, developing and applying novel methodologies, and addressing policy questions at national, regional and global levels.
* We strive to do this in a diverse and inclusive environment, harnessing a range of 	perspectives and approaches to address these issues, and nurturing new scientists to fulfil their potential.

## Values

* We aim to create an inclusive environment through open discussion and active participation among group members. Through regular DRIaDD/GRAM team meetings, book clubs, and lab handbook updates we aim to foster collaboration, share progress, and discuss new ideas.  We are also dedicated to strengthening partnerships with other groups, engaging in open discussions, and sharing our research.
* We strive to be a supportive community that encourages growth and the well-being of all our members. This involves both nurturing individual independence and providing strong group support whenever needed. We aim to create a collaborative environment where we support each otherâ€™s work and develop skills that empower team members to excel both together and independently.
* We are committed to cultivating a diverse and inclusive environment that celebrates and embraces unique backgrounds, experiences, and skills. 
* We support group members to actively participate in a broad range of opportunities beyond our core activities. This includes research projects involving interaction with wider stakeholders and the wider community, involvement in committees such as EDIA (Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility), and mental health awareness activities.
* We encourage and support all members in maintaining a good work-life balance.
